      "Welcome to a series on programming quantum computers. There's no shortage of hype around quantum computing on the internet, but I am going to still outline the propositions made by quantum computing in general, as well as how this pertains to us and programmers who intend to work with quantum computers, which we will be doing immediately in this series.\n",
      "WarningThe subject matter of quantum physics in general is very advanced, complex, confusing, and complicated. I am not a quantum physics expert. Dare I suggest too, no one is a quantum physics expert, but there are people far more qualified than me to talk on the theories and physics side of things.\n",
      "I will still outline some basics, but I highly encourage you to dive into the theory and conceptual side of quantum physics on your own because I really am not the best person to educate there. I am going to focus mainly on the programming and application side of things here.\n",
      "That said, some basic foundation is required, so:\n",
      "What are quantum computers?Quantum computers are machines that work with qubits (quantum bits) rather than regular bits.\n",
      "What's a qubit?A regular bit is a transistor that registers either a high or low voltage, which corresponds to 1 or 0 respectively. Through advances in technology over the years, we have bits that are nearly the size of atoms, which is absolutely incredible.\n",
      "A quantum bit is a 2-state quantum \"device.\" Many things can be used as qubits, such as a photon's horizontal and vertical polarization, or the spin up or spin down of an electron. What this means for us as computer scientists is that a qubit can be a 0, 1, or both.\n",
      "Because...\n",
      "Qubits also have 2 other very important properties:\n",
      "\n",
      "Superposition - this is where a qubit is, while left unobserved, all of its possible states. Once observed, it will collapse into one of the possible states.\n",
      "Entanglement - This is where one qubit's state is linked to another. When entangled with eachother, a change in one of the entangled qubits will change the other instanty. At any distance. Take take that both of those words are fully intended. Instantly and *any* distance, which is what Einstein referred to as \"Spooky action at a distance,\" since this appeared to violate various rules like transmitting information faster than the speed of light. This is referred to as quantum non-locality. I haven't personally seen a compelling explanation as to why this isn't spooky action at a distance, but we are assured by super smart people that it isn't... even though the behavior is as such at least with what we'll be doing. Still seems spooky to me.\n",
      "What, what?You're going to be thinking that a lot, but these are the properties that make quantum computers very compelling to use for certain problems. Both superposition and entanglement seem like magic to me, but both are proven qualities of qubits.\n",
      "What problems are quantum computers for?Quantum computers wont be replacing classical computers. They're more likely to continue working alongside them, just as they are already doing today. As you will see, we tend use a classical computer to represent a quantum circuit to the quantum computer, the quantum computer runs some cycles on this circuit, and then reports back to us again with a classical bit response.\n",
      "Quantum computers work very well for problems that exponentially explode.\n",
      "Problems like logistics, such as the most ideal delivery route for trucks, or even concepts like planning for companies, where each choice branches out into new possible choices and opportunities.\n",
      "This might still seem vague. Let's consider you're planning a charity dinner and you're attempting to seat people together who will keep eachother in good, donating, moods.\n",
      "Let's pretend for now you just have 1 table with 5 seats. How many combinations do we have here? Well, it's 5x4x3x2x1, or 5 factorial, which is 120. This means there are 120 possible combinations.\n",
      "What happens if we added... just one more seat? That'd be 6 factorial, which gives us 6x5-factorial, or 720. Just one more seat is 6x as many combinations.\n",
      "What about 10 seats? That's 3,628,800 combinations.\n",
      "Modeling is probably the most near-term real-world example that I see quantum computers being useful.\n",
      "Classical computers can barely simulate many single molecules...and they do a very poor job of it (due to the issue of how many possibilities there are given a situation). You currently cant rely on a classical computer to do chemistry simulations reliably.\n",
      "A quantum computer can actually model many molecules already today reliably, and it only gets better from here seemingly.\n",
      "How do quantum computers consider, fundamentally, more possibilities at once?With classical computers:\n",
      "n_states = 2 x n_bits\n",
      "With quantum computers:\n",
      "n_states = 2^n_bits\n",
      "Being exponential like this gives us some phenomenal properties. This is why quantum computers can help us with heavy-optimization types of tasks, or just tasks that have many possibilities.\n",
      "Quantum computers are probabilityI think the simplest explanation of a quantum computer that I can come up with for now is that:\n",
      "Classical computers can approximate and synthesize probability, they are not truly accurate and can never be with most tasks that use probability, unless of course you really can fit the entire range of possibilities into memory. Then you can get pretty close. But again, the probability space tends to explode as you add more variables.\n",
      "Quantum computers do not model probability. They simply are the probability.\n",
      "For this reason, quantum computers are also great for modeling things like molecules. With quantum computers, we could perform many chemistry experiments solely on quantum computers, which should significantly speed up many areas of research.\n",
      "Sold! I want a quantum computer\n",
      "You can't really buy a quantum computer yet, unless you build one yourself. As much as I can guess, a quantum computer would likely be somewhere between ten million dollars and one hundred million dollars, if not more, and require specialized personel and equipment to keep running. It appears that DWAVE has actually sold at least one $15 million USD quantum computer. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have to admit though, I am a bit confused on exactly what D-Wave's computers are as compared to what IBM and Google are working on. D-Wave's machines have seemingly been able to have x50 more qubits than everyone else. I see they use some different methods, and no one has seemingly been able to prove their machines are inferior yet. This will be interesting to see play out. \n",
      "\n",
      "But we *can* access quantum computers in the cloud!So these companies who have no doubt spent hundreds of millions of dollars on these quantum computers...what do they do with them?\n",
      "It turns out, opening them up to the public, for free, is not uncommon.\n",
      "Google, Microsoft, IBM, D-Wave, and I am sure many others all offer some form of cloud-based quantum computer access.\n",
      "I checked into all of the providers that I knew about, and, surprisingly, found IBM's to be the easiest to get up and running with. You really can go from nothing to running on an actual quantum computer in a few minutes.\n",
      "For free.\n",
      "FREE.\n",
      "I feel  like making access to quantum computers free is like NASA letting people drive a Mars rover around Mars for free. It's insane!\n",
      "... but we're currently at a stage with Quantum computers where the technology exists but no one really knows what all we can do here, or what will come of it.\n",
      "So, let's take advantage of this absurd time and play with the bleeding edge of technology!\n",
      "IBM has also done what I would call a phenomenal job with making both the tools as well as education available for free to anyone who is interested in diving in. I hope to continue this trend for them.\n",
      "Requisites:I am assuming you already have python installed and are beyond the python basics. If not, please start with the basics here: Python 3 programming basics tutorial.\n",
      "pip install qiskit numpy jupyterlab matplotlib qiskit-ibmq-provider\n",
      "I personally found that I had to force install qiskit-ibmq-provider:\n",
      "(on linux):\n",
      "sudo pip3.7 install --upgrade --force-reinstall qiskit-ibmq-provider\n",

      "Welcome to a series on programming quantum computers. There's no shortage of hype around quantum computing on the internet, but I am going to still outline the propositions made by quantum computing in general, as well as how this pertains to us and programmers who intend to work with quantum computers, which we will be doing immediately in this series.\n",
      "WarningThe subject matter of quantum physics in general is very advanced, complex, confusing, and complicated. I am not a quantum physics expert. Dare I suggest too, no one is a quantum physics expert, but there are people far more qualified than me to talk on the theories and physics side of things.\n",
      "I will still outline some basics, but I highly encourage you to dive into the theory and conceptual side of quantum physics on your own because I really am not the best person to educate there. I am going to focus mainly on the programming and application side of things here.\n",
      "That said, some basic foundation is required, so:\n",
      "What are quantum computers?Quantum computers are machines that work with qubits (quantum bits) rather than regular bits.\n",
      "What's a qubit?A regular bit is a transistor that registers either a high or low voltage, which corresponds to 1 or 0 respectively. Through advances in technology over the years, we have bits that are nearly the size of atoms, which is absolutely incredible.\n",
      "A quantum bit is a 2-state quantum \"device.\" Many things can be used as qubits, such as a photon's horizontal and vertical polarization, or the spin up or spin down of an electron. What this means for us as computer scientists is that a qubit can be a 0, 1, or both.\n",
      "Because...\n",
      "Qubits also have 2 other very important properties:\n",
      "\n",
      "Superposition - this is where a qubit is, while left unobserved, all of its possible states. Once observed, it will collapse into one of the possible states.\n",
      "Entanglement - This is where one qubit's state is linked to another. When entangled with eachother, a change in one of the entangled qubits will change the other instanty. At any distance. Take take that both of those words are fully intended. Instantly and *any* distance, which is what Einstein referred to as \"Spooky action at a distance,\" since this appeared to violate various rules like transmitting information faster than the speed of light. This is referred to as quantum non-locality. I haven't personally seen a compelling explanation as to why this isn't spooky action at a distance, but we are assured by super smart people that it isn't... even though the behavior is as such at least with what we'll be doing. Still seems spooky to me.\n",
      "What, what?You're going to be thinking that a lot, but these are the properties that make quantum computers very compelling to use for certain problems. Both superposition and entanglement seem like magic to me, but both are proven qualities of qubits.\n",
      "What problems are quantum computers for?Quantum computers wont be replacing classical computers. They're more likely to continue working alongside them, just as they are already doing today. As you will see, we tend use a classical computer to represent a quantum circuit to the quantum computer, the quantum computer runs some cycles on this circuit, and then reports back to us again with a classical bit response.\n",
      "Quantum computers work very well for problems that exponentially explode.\n",
      "Problems like logistics, such as the most ideal delivery route for trucks, or even concepts like planning for companies, where each choice branches out into new possible choices and opportunities.\n",
      "This might still seem vague. Let's consider you're planning a charity dinner and you're attempting to seat people together who will keep eachother in good, donating, moods.\n",
      "Let's pretend for now you just have 1 table with 5 seats. How many combinations do we have here? Well, it's 5x4x3x2x1, or 5 factorial, which is 120. This means there are 120 possible combinations.\n",
      "What happens if we added... just one more seat? That'd be 6 factorial, which gives us 6x5-factorial, or 720. Just one more seat is 6x as many combinations.\n",
      "What about 10 seats? That's 3,628,800 combinations.\n",
      "Modeling is probably the most near-term real-world example that I see quantum computers being useful.\n",
      "Classical computers can barely simulate many single molecules...and they do a very poor job of it (due to the issue of how many possibilities there are given a situation). You currently cant rely on a classical computer to do chemistry simulations reliably.\n",
      "A quantum computer can actually model many molecules already today reliably, and it only gets better from here seemingly.\n",
      "How do quantum computers consider, fundamentally, more possibilities at once?With classical computers:\n",
      "n_states = 2 x n_bits\n",
      "With quantum computers:\n",
      "n_states = 2^n_bits\n",
      "Being exponential like this gives us some phenomenal properties. This is why quantum computers can help us with heavy-optimization types of tasks, or just tasks that have many possibilities.\n",
      "Quantum computers are probabilityI think the simplest explanation of a quantum computer that I can come up with for now is that:\n",
      "Classical computers can approximate and synthesize probability, they are not truly accurate and can never be with most tasks that use probability, unless of course you really can fit the entire range of possibilities into memory. Then you can get pretty close. But again, the probability space tends to explode as you add more variables.\n",
      "Quantum computers do not model probability. They simply are the probability.\n",
      "For this reason, quantum computers are also great for modeling things like molecules. With quantum computers, we could perform many chemistry experiments solely on quantum computers, which should significantly speed up many areas of research.\n",
      "Sold! I want a quantum computer\n",
      "You can't really buy a quantum computer yet, unless you build one yourself. As much as I can guess, a quantum computer would likely be somewhere between ten million dollars and one hundred million dollars, if not more, and require specialized personel and equipment to keep running. It appears that DWAVE has actually sold at least one $15 million USD quantum computer. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have to admit though, I am a bit confused on exactly what D-Wave's computers are as compared to what IBM and Google are working on. D-Wave's machines have seemingly been able to have x50 more qubits than everyone else. I see they use some different methods, and no one has seemingly been able to prove their machines are inferior yet. This will be interesting to see play out. \n",

There's no shortage of hype around quantum computing on the internet, but I am going to still outline the propositions made by quantum computing in general, as well as how this pertains to us and programmers who intend to work with quantum computers, which we will be doing immediately in this series.\n",
      "WarningThe subject matter of quantum physics in general is very advanced, complex, confusing, and complicated. I am not a quantum physics expert. Dare I suggest too, no one is a quantum physics expert, but there are people far more qualified than me to talk on the theories and physics side of things.\n",
      "I will still outline some basics, but I highly encourage you to dive into the theory and conceptual side of quantum physics on your own because I really am not the best person to educate there. I am going to focus mainly on the programming and application side of things here.\n",
      "That said, some basic foundation is required, so:\n",
      "What are quantum computers?Quantum computers are machines that work with qubits (quantum bits) rather than regular bits.\n",
      "What's a qubit?A regular bit is a transistor that registers either a high or low voltage, which corresponds to 1 or 0 respectively. Through advances in technology over the years, we have bits that are nearly the size of atoms, which is absolutely incredible.\n",
      "A quantum bit is a 2-state quantum \"device.\" Many things can be used as qubits, such as a photon's horizontal and vertical polarization, or the spin up or spin down of an electron. What this means for us as computer scientists is that a qubit can be a 0, 1, or both.\n",
      "Because...\n",
      "Qubits also have 2 other very important properties:\n",
      "\n",
      "Superposition - this is where a qubit is, while left unobserved, all of its possible states. Once observed, it will collapse into one of the possible states.\n",
      "Entanglement - This is where one qubit's state is linked to another. When entangled with eachother, a change in one of the entangled qubits will change the other instanty. At any distance. Take take that both of those words are fully intended. Instantly and *any* distance, which is what Einstein referred to as \"Spooky action at a distance,\" since this appeared to violate various rules like transmitting information faster than the speed of light. This is referred to as quantum non-locality. I haven't personally seen a compelling explanation as to why this isn't spooky action at a distance, but we are assured by super smart people that it isn't... even though the behavior is as such at least with what we'll be doing. Still seems spooky to me.\n",
      "What, what?You're going to be thinking that a lot, but these are the properties that make quantum computers very compelling to use for certain problems. Both superposition and entanglement seem like magic to me, but both are proven qualities of qubits.\n",
      "What problems are quantum computers for?Quantum computers wont be replacing classical computers. They're more likely to continue working alongside them, just as they are already doing today. As you will see, we tend use a classical computer to represent a quantum circuit to the quantum computer, the quantum computer runs some cycles on this circuit, and then reports back to us again with a classical bit response.\n",
      "Quantum computers work very well for problems that exponentially explode.\n",
      "Problems like logistics, such as the most ideal delivery route for trucks, or even concepts like planning for companies, where each choice branches out into new possible choices and opportunities.\n",
      "This might still seem vague. Let's consider you're planning a charity dinner and you're attempting to seat people together who will keep eachother in good, donating, moods.\n",
      "Let's pretend for now you just have 1 table with 5 seats. How many combinations do we have here? Well, it's 5x4x3x2x1, or 5 factorial, which is 120. This means there are 120 possible combinations.\n",
      "What happens if we added... just one more seat? That'd be 6 factorial, which gives us 6x5-factorial, or 720. Just one more seat is 6x as many combinations.\n",
      "What about 10 seats? That's 3,628,800 combinations.\n",
      "Modeling is probably the most near-term real-world example that I see quantum computers being useful.\n",
      "Classical computers can barely simulate many single molecules...and they do a very poor job of it (due to the issue of how many possibilities there are given a situation). You currently cant rely on a classical computer to do chemistry simulations reliably.\n",
      "A quantum computer can actually model many molecules already today reliably, and it only gets better from here seemingly.\n",
      "How do quantum computers consider, fundamentally, more possibilities at once?With classical computers:\n",
      "n_states = 2 x n_bits\n",
      "With quantum computers:\n",
      "n_states = 2^n_bits\n",
      "Being exponential like this gives us some phenomenal properties. This is why quantum computers can help us with heavy-optimization types of tasks, or just tasks that have many possibilities.\n",
      "Quantum computers are probabilityI think the simplest explanation of a quantum computer that I can come up with for now is that:\n",
      "Classical computers can approximate and synthesize probability, they are not truly accurate and can never be with most tasks that use probability, unless of course you really can fit the entire range of possibilities into memory. Then you can get pretty close. But again, the probability space tends to explode as you add more variables.\n",
      "Quantum computers do not model probability. They simply are the probability.\n",
      "For this reason, quantum computers are also great for modeling things like molecules. With quantum computers, we could perform many chemistry experiments solely on quantum computers, which should significantly speed up many areas of research.\n",
      "Sold! I want a quantum computer\n",
      "You can't really buy a quantum computer yet, unless you build one yourself. As much as I can guess, a quantum computer would likely be somewhere between ten million dollars and one hundred million dollars, if not more, and require specialized personel and equipment to keep running. It appears that DWAVE has actually sold at least one $15 million USD quantum computer. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have to admit though, I am a bit confused on exactly what D-Wave's computers are as compared to what IBM and Google are working on. D-Wave's machines have seemingly been able to have x50 more qubits than everyone else. I see they use some different methods, and no one has seemingly been able to prove their machines are inferior yet. This will be interesting to see play out. \n",
      "\n",
      "But we *can* access quantum computers in the cloud!So these companies who have no doubt spent hundreds of millions of dollars on these quantum computers...what do they do with them?\n",
      "It turns out, opening them up to the public, for free, is not uncommon.\n",
      "Google, Microsoft, IBM, D-Wave, and I am sure many others all offer some form of cloud-based quantum computer access.\n",
      "I checked into all of the providers that I knew about, and, surprisingly, found IBM's to be the easiest to get up and running with. You really can go from nothing to running on an actual quantum computer in a few minutes.\n",
      "For free.\n",
      "FREE.\n",
      "I feel  like making access to quantum computers free is like NASA letting people drive a Mars rover around Mars for free. It's insane!\n",
      "... but we're currently at a stage with Quantum computers where the technology exists but no one really knows what all we can do here, or what will come of it.\n",
      "So, let's take advantage of this absurd time and play with the bleeding edge of technology!\n",
      "IBM has also done what I would call a phenomenal job with making both the tools as well as education available for free to anyone who is interested in diving in. I hope to continue this trend for them.\n",
      "Requisites:I am assuming you already have python installed and are beyond the python basics. If not, please start with the basics here: Python 3 programming basics tutorial.\n",
      "pip install qiskit numpy jupyterlab matplotlib qiskit-ibmq-provider\n",
      "I personally found that I had to force install qiskit-ibmq-provider:\n",

      "Welcome to a series on programming quantum computers. There's no shortage of hype around quantum computing on the internet, but I am going to still outline the propositions made by quantum computing in general, as well as how this pertains to us and programmers who intend to work with quantum computers, which we will be doing immediately in this series.\n",
      "WarningThe subject matter of quantum physics in general is very advanced, complex, confusing, and complicated. I am not a quantum physics expert. Dare I suggest too, no one is a quantum physics expert, but there are people far more qualified than me to talk on the theories and physics side of things.\n",
      "I will still outline some basics, but I highly encourage you to dive into the theory and conceptual side of quantum physics on your own because I really am not the best person to educate there. I am going to focus mainly on the programming and application side of things here.\n",
      "That said, some basic foundation is required, so:\n",
      "What are quantum computers?Quantum computers are machines that work with qubits (quantum bits) rather than regular bits.\n",
      "What's a qubit?A regular bit is a transistor that registers either a high or low voltage, which corresponds to 1 or 0 respectively. Through advances in technology over the years, we have bits that are nearly the size of atoms, which is absolutely incredible.\n",
      "A quantum bit is a 2-state quantum \"device.\" Many things can be used as qubits, such as a photon's horizontal and vertical polarization, or the spin up or spin down of an electron. What this means for us as computer scientists is that a qubit can be a 0, 1, or both.\n",
      "Because...\n",
      "Qubits also have 2 other very important properties:\n",
      "\n",
      "Superposition - this is where a qubit is, while left unobserved, all of its possible states. Once observed, it will collapse into one of the possible states.\n",
      "Entanglement - This is where one qubit's state is linked to another. When entangled with eachother, a change in one of the entangled qubits will change the other instanty. At any distance. Take take that both of those words are fully intended. Instantly and *any* distance, which is what Einstein referred to as \"Spooky action at a distance,\" since this appeared to violate various rules like transmitting information faster than the speed of light. This is referred to as quantum non-locality. I haven't personally seen a compelling explanation as to why this isn't spooky action at a distance, but we are assured by super smart people that it isn't... even though the behavior is as such at least with what we'll be doing. Still seems spooky to me.\n",
      "What, what?You're going to be thinking that a lot, but these are the properties that make quantum computers very compelling to use for certain problems. Both superposition and entanglement seem like magic to me, but both are proven qualities of qubits.\n",
      "What problems are quantum computers for?Quantum computers wont be replacing classical computers. They're more likely to continue working alongside them, just as they are already doing today. As you will see, we tend use a classical computer to represent a quantum circuit to the quantum computer, the quantum computer runs some cycles on this circuit, and then reports back to us again with a classical bit response.\n",
      "Quantum computers work very well for problems that exponentially explode.\n",
      "Problems like logistics, such as the most ideal delivery route for trucks, or even concepts like planning for companies, where each choice branches out into new possible choices and opportunities.\n",
      "This might still seem vague. Let's consider you're planning a charity dinner and you're attempting to seat people together who will keep eachother in good, donating, moods.\n",
      "Let's pretend for now you just have 1 table with 5 seats. How many combinations do we have here? Well, it's 5x4x3x2x1, or 5 factorial, which is 120. This means there are 120 possible combinations.\n",
      "What happens if we added... just one more seat? That'd be 6 factorial, which gives us 6x5-factorial, or 720. Just one more seat is 6x as many combinations.\n",
      "What about 10 seats? That's 3,628,800 combinations.\n",
      "Modeling is probably the most near-term real-world example that I see quantum computers being useful.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello and welcome to a Go Language programming tutorial. In this series, we're going to cover setting up and the basics of using Go in a practical way. Go is a programming language where you could easily run through the basics, and then be totally lost when it comes to actually applying it to some actual task. Because of this, we're going to learn and immediately apply at the same time as we move through these concepts.\n",
      "First off, why might we be interested in the Go programming language? For me, since I mainly program in Python, I am going to compare it to a high-level language like that. Go was developed by Google to solve challenges that they were facing, purpose built from the ground up. A language like Python is great for rapid development and many tasks, but, due to the GIL and dynamic typing, it can sometimes be slow. If you scale out Python to millions of instances, you pay quite the price in performance and cost as opposed to if you had written the same program in C++. The problem is, however, C++ isn't the most enjoyable language to program in, nor is it the most friendly to learn.\n",
      "Go is a static-typed language (as opposed to dynamic typing with something like Python), and has concepts like concurrency baked in right from the start. For me personally, my main interest in Go is for web development, but I can see it being useful for a variety of high-volume types of tasks and just systems in general. Not only does Go have web frameworks, the language itself comes out of the gate with full web support, a built in web server, and could be considered already a low-level web framework.\n",
      "To begin, we need Go. You can download Go here. In Windows, you can just grab a simple installer, a .pkg for Mac, or a tarball for Linux. If you are on Linux, make sure you add Go to your path. You can do that by:\n",
      "nano ~/.profile\n",
      "And then add the following to the end of the file:\n",
      "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n",
      "Save, exit and then do:\n",
      "$ source  ~/.profile\n",
      "A simple Go program will just consist of a single .go file. You can make and edit this file with whatever you want. I will personally be using Sublime Text. On Windows, it's a simple .exe installer, on Linux you can get Sublime with:\n",
      "$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-3\n",
      "$ sudo apt-get update\n",
      "$ sudo apt-get install sublime-text-installer\n",
      "To run your files, you use your terminal / cmd.exe and use the syntax: go run YOURFILE.go\n",
      "Let's write a quick basic Go program to see if we've got everything setup and ready to go:\n",
      "gointro.go\n",
      "package main\n",
      "\n",
      "import \"fmt\"\n",
      "\n",
      "func main() {\n",
      "\tfmt.Println(\"Welcome to Go!\")\n",
      "}\n",
      "To run this, we can do go run gointro.go, and you should see:\n",
      "Welcome to Go!\n",
      "If you made it this far, congratulations on your first Go program! Let's cover briefly what each line is doing. I will do this by commenting above or beside the lines what they do. If you do not know what comments are in programming, they are ways to write notes and such in your code that will not be run as actual code when your program runs. In Go, the way you can do single-line comments is with // and you can do multi-line comments with /* and end with */\n",
      "package main //go programs consist of packages, and start with main\n",
      "\n",
      "// import a library/package. In this case we import fmt, which brings in \n",
      "// standard formatted I/O strings from C\n",
      "import \"fmt\"\n",

      "\t//print line just outputs what you mass. \n",
      "\t// Println is a function from the fmt library\n",
      "\t// we can reference other packages from fmt with .\n",
      "\tfmt.Println(\"Welcome to Go!\")\n",

      "Hello and welcome to a Go Language programming tutorial. In this series, we're going to cover setting up and the basics of using Go in a practical way. Go is a programming language where you could easily run through the basics, and then be totally lost when it comes to actually applying it to some actual task. Because of this, we're going to learn and immediately apply at the same time as we move through these concepts.\n",
      "First off, why might we be interested in the Go programming language? For me, since I mainly program in Python, I am going to compare it to a high-level language like that. Go was developed by Google to solve challenges that they were facing, purpose built from the ground up. A language like Python is great for rapid development and many tasks, but, due to the GIL and dynamic typing, it can sometimes be slow. If you scale out Python to millions of instances, you pay quite the price in performance and cost as opposed to if you had written the same program in C++. The problem is, however, C++ isn't the most enjoyable language to program in, nor is it the most friendly to learn.\n",
      "Go is a static-typed language (as opposed to dynamic typing with something like Python), and has concepts like concurrency baked in right from the start. For me personally, my main interest in Go is for web development, but I can see it being useful for a variety of high-volume types of tasks and just systems in general. Not only does Go have web frameworks, the language itself comes out of the gate with full web support, a built in web server, and could be considered already a low-level web framework.\n",
      "To begin, we need Go. You can download Go here. In Windows, you can just grab a simple installer, a .pkg for Mac, or a tarball for Linux. If you are on Linux, make sure you add Go to your path. You can do that by:\n",

      "Hello and welcome to a Go Language programming tutorial. In this series, we're going to cover setting up and the basics of using Go in a practical way. Go is a programming language where you could easily run through the basics, and then be totally lost when it comes to actually applying it to some actual task. Because of this, we're going to learn and immediately apply at the same time as we move through these concepts.\n",
      "First off, why might we be interested in the Go programming language? For me, since I mainly program in Python, I am going to compare it to a high-level language like that. Go was developed by Google to solve challenges that they were facing, purpose built from the ground up. A language like Python is great for rapid development and many tasks, but, due to the GIL and dynamic typing, it can sometimes be slow. If you scale out Python to millions of instances, you pay quite the price in performance and cost as opposed to if you had written the same program in C++. The problem is, however, C++ isn't the most enjoyable language to program in, nor is it the most friendly to learn.\n",
      "Go is a static-typed language (as opposed to dynamic typing with something like Python), and has concepts like concurrency baked in right from the start. For me personally, my main interest in Go is for web development, but I can see it being useful for a variety of high-volume types of tasks and just systems in general. Not only does Go have web frameworks, the language itself comes out of the gate with full web support, a built in web server, and could be considered already a low-level web framework.\n",
      "To begin, we need Go. You can download Go here. In Windows, you can just grab a simple installer, a .pkg for Mac, or a tarball for Linux. If you are on Linux, make sure you add Go to your path. You can do that by:\n",
      "nano ~/.profile\n",
      "And then add the following to the end of the file:\n",
      "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n",
      "Save, exit and then do:\n",
      "$ source  ~/.profile\n",
      "A simple Go program will just consist of a single .go file. You can make and edit this file with whatever you want. I will personally be using Sublime Text. On Windows, it's a simple .exe installer, on Linux you can get Sublime with:\n",
      "$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-3\n",
      "$ sudo apt-get update\n",
      "$ sudo apt-get install sublime-text-installer\n",
      "To run your files, you use your terminal / cmd.exe and use the syntax: go run YOURFILE.go\n",
      "Let's write a quick basic Go program to see if we've got everything setup and ready to go:\n",
      "gointro.go\n",
      "package main\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "func main() {\n",
      "\tfmt.Println(\"Welcome to Go!\")\n",
      "}\n",
      "To run this, we can do go run gointro.go, and you should see:\n",
      "Welcome to Go!\n",
      "If you made it this far, congratulations on your first Go program! Let's cover briefly what each line is doing. I will do this by commenting above or beside the lines what they do.
